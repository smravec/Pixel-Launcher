# Launcher

This is a fork of [finnmglas's app Launcher][original-repo].

Or download the latest APK from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/jrpie/Launcher/releases/latest).

## Notable changes:

* Edge gestures: There is a setting to allow distinguishing swiping at the edges of the screen from swiping in the center.
* Compatible with [work profile](https://www.android.com/enterprise/work-profile/), so apps like [Shelter](https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/Shelter) can be used.

### Visual
* This app uses the system wallpaper instead of a custom solution.
* The font has been changed to [Hack][hack-font].
* Font Awesome Icons were replaced by Material icons.
* The gear button on the home screen was removed. Instead pressing back opens the list of applications and the app settings are accessible from there.


### Search
* The search algorithm was modified to prefer matches at the beginning of the app name, i.e. when searching for `"te"`, `"termux"` is sorted before `"notes"`.
* The search bar was moved to the bottom of the screen.

### Technical
* Small improvements to the gesture detection.
* Different apps set as default.
* Package name was changed to `de.jrpie.android.launcher` to avoid clashing with the original app.
* Dropped support for API < 21 (i.e. pre Lollypop)
* Some refactoring
